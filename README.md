# Unaffiliated

The purpose of this project is to work on practical, simple, and possibly even useful examples of cryptography in Rust for the purpose of self-improvement and resiliance against totalitarian regimes.

Planned examples include:

## Hashing

## Signing / verification

## Encryption / decryption

## Diffie-Hellman key exchange

## Messaging

Pull requests are not only welcome, but they're the whole point!
